 1: create a neural network class with feedforward. make sure the feedforward is done using matrix maths, and that it outputs the whole array of z and a values, rather than just the final a value.
 2: implement sigmoid(z) and sigmoid_prime(z)
 3: create a dC/dz function, that computes the loss of the output nodes. maybe make it work with the 'multi-example, one matrix' technique
 4: read http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html#the_backpropagation_algorithm and look back over the 4 equations to decide how to implement the_backpropagation_algorithm
