# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction
In the past, I have built many neural network models, but have neglected to learn backpropogation. I have always used brute force and randomisation for the training process. Now that I've graduated high school and am familiar with calculus and matrices, I have decided to learn backpropagation through this project.

My goal with this project is to apply my knowledge of calculus and matrices to learn how backpropagation works, and to implement it.

I will also make the model scalable to any size, so that this program could potentially be used as an API for a real project.

## Features
 * *not yet implemented* Neural network model with scalable size, and feedforward capability using weight matrices
 * *not yet implemented* Backpropagation step function that can be iterated
 * *not yet implemented* GUI capability, so the api could be used as a standalone program
 * *not yet implemented* More sophisticated types of neural network, like CNNs or RNNs, rather than the basic feedforward net

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)
