 - create a neural network class with feedforward. make sure the feedforward is done using matrix maths, and that it outputs the whole array of z and a values, rather than just the final a value.
 - implement sigmoid(z) and sigmoid_prime(z)
 - create a dC/dz function, that computes the loss of the output nodes. maybe make it work with the 'multi-example, one matrix' technique at https://youtu.be/xy5MOQpx3aQ
