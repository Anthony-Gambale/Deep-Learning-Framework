# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction
In the past, I have built many neural network models, but have neglected to learn backpropogation. Instead, I have always used brute force and randomisation to 'train' models. However, now that I have learned calculus and matrices in high school, I am determined to learn backpropogation through this project.

My goal with this project is to apply my knowledge of calculus and matrices to learn how backpropagation works, and to implement it.

The neural network will be scalable to any size, based on user input.

While this project is originally designed to be used as an API, I may add a GUI in future, allowing the program to be used as a standalone app.

## Features
 * Neural network with scalable size and feedforward capability
 * 

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)
