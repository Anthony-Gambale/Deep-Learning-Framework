 1: create a neural network object with feedforward. make sure the feedforward is done using matrix maths, and that it outputs the whole array of z and a values, rather than just the final a value.
 2: implement sigmoid(z) and sigmoid_prime(z)
 3: create a dC/dz function, that computes the loss of the output nodes.
 4: make step 3 work with the 'multi-example, one matrix' technique
 5: implement the second equation of backpropagation. Make a function that returns an array of all the dC/dz values for each layer.
 6: implement dC/db using dC/dz

to-do
 7: implement dC/dw using dC/dz
