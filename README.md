# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction
My goal with this project is to apply my knowledge of calculus and matrices to learn how backpropagation works, and to implement it.

The neural network will be scalable to any size, based on user input.

While this project is originally designed to be used as an API, I may add a GUI in future, allowing the program to be used as a standalone app.

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)
