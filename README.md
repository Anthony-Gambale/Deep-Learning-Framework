# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction

My goal with this project is to combine my knowledge of calculus/matrices with my knowledge of the feedforward function in neural networks, to learn the concept of backpropagation. The final goal is to be able to implement it in this project.

I will also make the model scalable to any size, so that this program could potentially be used as an API for a real project.

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations) ```python -m pip install numpy```

## Installing and Running
*(not yet implemented)*

## Features
 * Neural network model with scalable size, and feedforward capability using weight matrices
 * *(not yet implemented)* Backpropagation step function, that can be iterated
 * *(not yet implemented)* I might use the API to create a GUI web app, where the user can experiment with different sizes and datasets
 * *(not yet implemented)* More sophisticated types of neural networks, like CNNs or RNNs, rather than the basic feedforward net
