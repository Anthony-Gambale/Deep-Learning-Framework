# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction

My goal with this project is to apply my knowledge of calculus and matrices with my knowledge of the neural network feedforward algorithm, to learn the concept of backpropagation. The final goal is to be able to implement it in this project.

I will also make the model scalable to any size, so that this program could potentially be used as an API for a real project.

## Features
 * *(not yet implemented)* Neural network model with scalable size, and feedforward capability using weight matrices
 * *(not yet implemented)* Backpropagation step function that can be iterated
 * *(not yet implemented)* GUI capability, so the api could be used as a standalone program
 * *(not yet implemented)* More sophisticated types of neural network, like CNNs or RNNs, rather than the basic feedforward net

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)
