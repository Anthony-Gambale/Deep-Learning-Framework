# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction
In the past, I have built many neural network models, but have neglected to learn backpropogation. Instead, I have always used brute force and randomisation for the training process. Now that I've graduated high school and am familiar with calculus and matrices, I am determined to learn backpropogation through this project.

My goal with this project is to apply my knowledge of calculus and matrices to learn how backpropagation works, and to implement it.

I will also make the model scalable to any size, so that this program could potentially be used as an API for a real project.

## Features
 * Neural network model with scalable size, and feedforward capability using weight matrices
 * Backpropagation step function that can be iterated
 * 

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)
