# Deep-Learning-Framework
A deep learning framework, made from scratch in python.

## Introduction

My goal with this project is to learn the concept of backpropagation. I am already familiar with neural network feedforward, as well as core calculus and linear algebra, so backpropagation is my next major milestone. My final goal is to implement it in this project.

I will also make the model scalable to any size, so that this program could potentially be used as a tool for real data analysis.

Also, I am going to challenge myself to program the entire thing without reading the example code in Michael Nielsen's book. Instead, I'm going to study the algorithms conceptually, and try to implement them 'freestyle.' This is because I want to make sure I'm properly learning the concepts, rather than mindlessly plagiarising.

## Requirements
 * Numpy (for matrix operations)  
```python -m pip install numpy```

## Installing and Running
*(not yet implemented)*

## Features
 * Neural network model with scalable size, and feedforward capability using weight matrices
 * *(started)* Backpropagation step function, that can be iterated
 * *(started)* Support one-step, multi-example learning, by squashing multiple examples into one single matrix
 * *(not yet implemented)* Use the API to create a GUI app, where the user can experiment with different network configs and datasets, and the neural network they create is displayed in a graph on the screen
 * *(not yet implemented)* More sophisticated types of neural networks, like CNNs or RNNs, rather than the basic feedforward net
